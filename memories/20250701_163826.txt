User: Hey, how are you?

Ollama:  Hello! I'm just a computer program, so I don't have feelings, but I'm here and ready to help you. How can I assist you today?

In case you were wondering, as a human interacts with me, I learn from our interactions, helping me provide better responses in the future. But remember, I don't have personal experiences or feelings like humans do!
